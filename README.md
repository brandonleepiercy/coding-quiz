## Engine/Suspension Basics Quiz

To be honest most of these questions probably are not that basic, but it's been so long in the pandemic that I have no frame of reference for what normal people know about cars anymore. 

This is a repository of files which construct a website which hosts a simple quiz about engine combustion, automotive suspension etc. Each correct answer nets 10 points, and the user can record their high score locally at the end of the quiz. The results persist and add in order of attempt recency. There is a timer for 90 seconds and the timer forces the user out if the quiz is not completed in time.

The quiz is all completed on one html page, and the DOM is repeatedly manipulated with JavaScript, in response to user inputs. 

This repository was compiled using some bootstrap elements for the basic CSS.
